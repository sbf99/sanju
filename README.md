Sanju Tree Project, Phase 2



1) Please rotate the video 90 degrees to the right. [Sample Rotated File here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/70ki8l3ig036ha8b841q0/SanjuTreeTestRotateRight90.mp4?rlkey=dte3m26ni5h81q35hcy7r1hk3&dl=0) (* explanation below)
2) Eventually when you have time, please don't forget to provide the initial video for looping (or blank screen, if preferred) at the beginning of the file. (It can be whatever length, I just need to change [one number in the code](https://github.com/sbf99/sanju/blob/337072864ded3516b9e6219965168a4e8b189b49/playVideo.py#L39) to make it work)
3) Program will automatically detect any file that starts with case-insensitive "sanju" and ends with "mp4" on any USB drive that's plugged in. (Examples would be anything like "sanju 2024-01-23.mp4" or "SanjuTreeVideos.mp4" or whatever you like). But there must only be ONE file that fits this condition on the drive or else it won't know what file to pick.

   
Explanation on why 90-degree rotation: 

Again, non-fullscreen I was able to rotate the video, but the video was fullscreen, it was the wrong orientation again. I tried many different settings and techniques I found on the internet to try to fix this, and none of them were working. Many people had trouble also. It is just easier to rotate the video, and now everything looks fine!  (I used iMovie to do this easily, should be easy in Premiere, etc. also)
